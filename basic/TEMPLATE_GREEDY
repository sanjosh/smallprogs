Greedy(a, n) / a[1:n] contains the n inputs
{
    sol = 0
    for i = 1 to n
    {
        x = Select(a)
        if feasible(solution, n) 
        {
            solution = Union(solution, n) 
        }
    }
    return solution
}

Most Greedy algo (not all) can be defined by matroid structure
M (S, I) where S = finite set and I = indep subsets of S

Greedy(M, w)
{
    A=null
    sort M.S into decreasing order by weight
    for each x n M.S, taken in decreasing order of weight
        if A + {x} belongs to M.I
            A = A + {x}
    return A
}
