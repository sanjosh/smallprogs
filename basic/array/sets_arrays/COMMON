use stack of open problems  - as in max area of histogram - see karumanchi chap5,prob 24

(Karumanchi page 275 notes)
1) use XOR
1) use Hash table
1) use Dutch National flag (maintain 2 ptrs)
1) use 2 passes 
1) traverse from right or left
1) use transitivity
1) use stack or tree or hash
1) keep array of prefix sums (left and right) - and subtract
1) negation of each A[i] elem
1) addition of size to each A[i] elem
1) swapping A[i] and A[A[i]]
1) make functions over the numbers - Newton symmetric poly
1) compute hash on f([A[i])
1) Randomized algo select arbitrary elements
1) Divide Array into bins - Pigeonhole - to find duplicate elems 
1) Binary search / Fibonnaci search
1) swap using (x + y * sz)/sz = y and (x + y * sz)%sz = x

1) Inversion table uniquely determines permutation (Marshall Hall in Knuth vol 3)

=======================================
to find local maxima in array - 
    use "peak detection in time series"  - compare a[i] with a[i-1] and a[i+1]
    using wavelet
    detect zero crossings

compute sign array
    sign[i] = a[i] - a[i+1]
    2 3 4 5 3 2 1
    - - - - + + +

compute derivative
    der[i] = a[i+1] - a[i]/unit(1)
    1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 

    2nd derivative
    2der[i] 
    0 0 0 -2 0 0 
    if 2der < 0, then f has local maxima
    if 2der > 0, then f has local minima

moving average
    oldave = oldave + (newnumber - oldaverage/numexecs)
moving average is a filter
============

max XOR sum in subarray:  trie


===============

RMQ
for any computation (min, gcd, lcm) over ranges
1) precompute 2D array 
2) segment tree
3) precompute over square root decomposition
4) keep sparse table over for each [i, i + 2^j]  for all j < log(n)

--------------

max element to right of each element - use STACK
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-nges-right/

stock span problem - use Stack

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/replace-every-element-with-the-greatest-on-right-side/

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-subarray-not-k-distinct-elements/

==========

inversions

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-inversions-of-size-three-in-a-give-array/

count of smaller elements to right  of each element - use BST
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-smaller-elements-on-right-side/

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-inversions-in-an-array-set-2-using-self-balancing-bst/

every node of Fenwick stores sum of subset of first n, where n is power of 2
parent = remove last set bit = index + (index & -index)

========

problems around smallest element in array
1. next on right : no intersect between consecutive nearest(i), hence use stack
2. farthest on right : there is intersect between consecutive nearest(i), hence use range array
3. count of smallest to right (inversion table) : put in tree or use merge sort
4. count of elem with at least one smaller to left and right : use stack + count

compute over fixed length moving window 
1. drop first char in window

smallest window in which all elements occur
1. detect first window
2. if start of window changes, do update 
3. keep smallest window so far

==========

SUM problems in unsorted

sum of any k = M where M is external or internal element of array
sum of any k < M where M is external or internal 

where elem is pos & negative

use
1. decrement any elem > sum/2 as elem = elem-sum/2; then find duplicates
1. hash of triplet
2. trie of triplet in sorted order
3. tree of sums of triplet

sum of pair = sum of another pair in array
