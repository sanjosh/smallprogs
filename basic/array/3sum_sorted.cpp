Given an array and a number, check whether there are any 3 elements in the array which add up to the given number.
  For example:
     Given an array {1,2,3,4,5} and the number 9, return true, as 2,3,4 add up to 9.
     Given an array {1,2,3,4,5} and the number 3, return false, as there are no 3 elements which add up to 3, in the array.
