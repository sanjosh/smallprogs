TODO
You are given a two dimension matrix of characters. You are also given a String (character pointer). You have to find whether that string could be formed in that grid. You can move in the following directions: namely right, left, up, down & diagonal (forward and backward). But you can search the word by moving in only one direction at a time (i.e. if after the first letter, the second letter has been found by moving right then the subsequent letters also must
be matched by moving right only. You cannot change the direction.). I gave him my approach using the Backtracking algorithm. He said that he liked my approach and asked me to write the full working code. He was very helpful and gave me hints whenever I was stuck. After a few minutes I wrote the code in C++.
