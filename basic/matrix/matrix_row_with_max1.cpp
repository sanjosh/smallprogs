Given a 2-D binary matrix(nxn)(elements are either 0 or 1) such that in each row,all the 1’s in the array are present before the 0’s.You have to return the row number of the row with max. no of 1’s.You just have to implement the function whose prototype looks like-
Int max_row(int *arr,int n);//here arr is a pointer to integer and nxn is the size of matrix.
