Binomial : lattice paths 

Catalan number : num of lattice paths which do not rise above diagonal
    num of triangulations of convex poly
    num of binary trees with n+1 leaves
    num of parentheses (() ())

Eulerian number <n/k> : num of n-len sequences with k ascents/descents

Stirling num first kind : num of perm of n with k cycles

Stirling num second kind : num of ways to partition n elem into k sets

===============

n-th Harmonic number Hn = Sum (1/i) from i=0..n


==========


inversions : pair(i,j) where entries in perm are in opposite order.
to bring perm with k inversions into order requires k transpositions
bubble sort and insertion sort are transposition based algo

number of perm of n with k inversions = Mahonian numbero

How to number permutations - 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation

==========

Robinson Schensted Knuth correspondence

From permutation => build Pair of Young tableau (P, Q)
longest incr subseq(perm) = length of first row of P
longest decr subseq(perm) = length of first col of P

Inversion table uniquely defines permutaton

Index(perm) = sum of j such that a[j] > a[j+1]

Count Inversions of array
= use Balanced tree
= use Merge sort
