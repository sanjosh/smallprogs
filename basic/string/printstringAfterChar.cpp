. Provided a string a character and a count, you have to print the string after the specified character has occurred count number of times.
Ex: String: “This is demo string”
Character: ‘i’
Count: 3
Output: “ng”
However, solving this one must take care of corner case when character is not in string or its not in string count number of times etc.
