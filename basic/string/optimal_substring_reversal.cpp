Optimal substring reversal
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/directi-interview-questions/

Question 1 (Optimal substring reversal):
    You are given a string S. Each character of S is either ‘a’, or ‘b’. You wish to reverse exactly one sub-string of S such that the new string is lexicographically smaller than all the other strings that you can get by reversing exactly one sub-string.
    For example, given ‘abab’, you may choose to reverse the substring ‘ab’ that starts from index 2 (0-based). This gives you the string ‘abba’. But, if you choose the reverse the substring ‘ba’ starting from index 1, you will get ‘aabb’. There is no way of getting a smaller string, hence reversing the substring in the range [1, 2] is optimal.
