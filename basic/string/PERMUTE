1) Inversion table

5 9 1 8 2 6 4 7 3
has inversion
2 3 6 4 0 2 2 1 0
because 2 elem (5,9) to left are greater than (1)
and 3 elem (5,9,8) to left are greater than (2)

max num of inversions = n-1 + n-2 + ... + 1
for perm of 4 elem, it is 6 = 3 + 2 + 1

2) Lehmer code  
    number of elem to right which are smaller than current pos j
    B E D A C
    1 3 2 0 0  
B > A
E > D,A,C
D > A,C
A > none
C > none

Bijective correspondene between Lehmer and Factorial number system
Every perm has a unique Lehmer code

3) factorial number system
leftmost base is 'n!'
rightmost is '1!'

15 = (2 x 3!) + (1 x 2!) + (1 x 1!) + (0 x 0!) = 12 + 2 + 1 + 0

6 permutations of "abc" are
000 abc
010 
100
110
200
210

4) Rothe diagram

==============
ENumerate all permutations
1) Trotter algo
    

2) For i = 0 to n! - 1:
 *    Represent i in factoradic base.
 *    Convert this representation to a Lehmer code.
 *    Generate the permutation based on this Lehmer code.

===========

Build perm using inversion table
go from right to left
