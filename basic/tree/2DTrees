http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/

Segment tree stores intervals, and optimized for "which of these intervals contains a given point" queries.
Interval tree stores intervals as well, but optimized for "which of these intervals overlap with a given interval" queries. It can also be used for point queries - similar to segment tree.
Range tree stores points, and optimized for "which points fall within a given interval" queries.
Binary indexed tree stores items-count per index, and optimized for "how many items are there between index m and n" queries.
Performance / Space consumption for one dimension:

Segment tree - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(k+logn) query time, O(n logn) space
Interval tree - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(k+logn) query time, O(n) space
Range tree - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(k+logn) query time, O(n) space
Binary Indexed tree - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(logn) query time, O(n) space

Approaches:
1) Quad Tree, R-tree, Octree
2) k-d tree
3) bitmap rep/Sparse matrix algo ?
4) latitude and longitude index
5) transform spherical to another domain - metric preserving

6) Locality preserving hash
7) Geohash (hilbert curve vs Z-curve)

hyperdim hash?
semantic hash for documents
spectral hash

====

one degree longitude difference differs greatly depending on the latitude. A longitude 1° from the equator is 111.321 km, but longitude 1° from latitude 60° is only 55.802 km.

Geohash 
Scheme : subdivide horizontally and vertically, represent each bit as a 0 or 1.
Disadvantage : The nearest point can have wildly different Geohash value, if the location is close to a grid-square boundary.   There is an algo for calculating the geohash values of the 8 surrounding grid-squares of a given grid square,

Issues by Andrew Rogers (SpaceCurve)
1) Resolution
2) Sharding
3) Approx for transcendental func
4) Polygon intersecc
5) Spatial joins across different data sources (say, weather and social media)

Proximity search

locality sensitive hashing : 
1) maximize probability of collision for similar items.  
2) Used for spam detection.
3) actual hash = concat of many primitive hash func

data dependent hash
1) Spherical LSH

how to do range scan

=======

Polygon intersection problem

1) bitmap rep - can do AND op 
2) decompose into triangles (like 3-regular graph)
3) Quantization - find nearest triangle

==========

Ways to tackle a problem
1) Exact vs Approx algo
2) Combination of algo methods
3) Transformation of problem domain

Ease of expanding given scheme into Distributed system 
Can the data be cached, sharded, 
Can state be easily recovered on failure (checkpoint/snapshot)
