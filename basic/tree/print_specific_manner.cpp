Given a perfect binary tree.
print nodes in a specific manner. e.g-

              15
             /  \
           13    14
         /  \    /  \
        9   10  11   12
       / \  / \ / \  / \
      1  2  3 4 5 6  7 8

print - 1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5 9 12 10 11 13 14 15 

I told her approaches having some space complexity. Again she restricted space complexity, and I got an efficient solution by recognizing some pattern
